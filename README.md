2048 Game

Description
2048 is a popular single-player puzzle game where the goal is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to create a tile with the number 2048. The game begins with two tiles, each displaying the number 2 or 4, randomly placed on a 4x4 grid. Players can move the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, or right. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into one tile displaying their sum. After each move, a new tile appears on the grid with a value of either 2 or 4. The game continues until the player achieves the 2048 tile or is unable to make any more moves, resulting in a game over. Players aim to reach the highest score possible by strategically combining tiles and minimizing the number of empty spaces on the grid.
